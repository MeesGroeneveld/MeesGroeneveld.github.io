        <h4> Hunting and behaviour </h4>

        <p> They sleep about 14-18 hours a day much like cats and hunt smal creatures like mice and unfortunate birds that arn't aware of there surroundings.
            They eat there prey whole including bones, organs and flesh within domasctic envourments they can be given high protian catfood. 
            Like mentioned before there quick, nimble and love smal spaces and will seek these out as much as possible.

<h5> My Opinion </h5>
<p> These adorable little creatures are a must have for me i'd love to have one as a pet. I knew about them but only knew they were used as pets when i watched a youruber show a new one they got for there lonley friend.
    they are a mix between cats and rats and i love those two creatures so its basicly best of both worlds, theyre high octane energy is super funny and can lead them to unexpected happenings.
    Appart from theyre domestication i love them in the wild because there verry family oriented and amezing survivors.
