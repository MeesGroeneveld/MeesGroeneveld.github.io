<H3>Habbitat</H3>
<p> They are only found at the coast of india and other large satlwater bodies of water. They live on the rocks of the coast and hunt there for fish you can find them in mangroves too.
</p>

<H4>Food and Hunting behaviour</H4>
<p> There able to run ontop of water for short distances with there large feet and tail as balance. They fish for food by diving down into the water or waiting for fish to strand onto the rocks.
</p>
<h5> My Opinion</h5>
<p> This awsome dragon like animal is so cool, im a sucker for lizards in general so when there big and called dragons im all over it. They can even run over water wich is super cool but there sadly also endangered wich really sucks
